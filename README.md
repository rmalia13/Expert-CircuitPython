## Hello CircuitPython

In Hello CircuitPython, I made a program that printed "Hello, world." and bounced a ball inside of a box that was drawn in Processing. I also learned how to create a GUI (Graphic User Interface) using Processing. This link: https://processing.org/examples/bounce.html?scrlybrkr=8cb5b43c was very helpful, and I only modified the code to change the size and the color of the background (and I had fun messing around with the speed and size of the ball).

## CircuitPython To Processing

In this assignment, we wired a potentiometer and made a GUI in Processing to display its position. We started by modifying clock code from Processing example code (https://processing.org/examples/clock.html). Getting the GUI to display the correct position of the potentiometer was difficult to do because we needed to make special variables for the data in order for it to work correctly and substitute these variables into the original clock code.

## Processing To CircuitPython

in this assignment we controled two servos with a GUI. We made a X variable and a Y variable dependent on the mouse's position inside the GUI's that controlled each servo.
